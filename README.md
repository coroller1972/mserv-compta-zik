# mserv-compta

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Database migrations

Database schema migrations are managed by Flyway and run automatically at application startup.

Migration files live in:

```text
src/main/resources/db/migration
```

Use Flyway naming for future changes, for example:

```text
V2__add_invoice_payment_status.sql
```

Hibernate validates the mapped schema at startup and no longer recreates tables in dev mode.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./gradlew build
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar build/*-runner.jar`.

## Container image

The container image is built by GitHub Actions from
`src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm.staged` and pushed to:

```text
ghcr.io/coroller1972/mserv-compta-zik:latest
```

This keeps the Gradle download out of the ROSA build path. ROSA only pulls the
already built runtime image.

## Deploying on OpenShift / ROSA

From the target namespace, apply the manifest:

```shell script
oc apply -f deploy.yml
oc rollout status deployment/mserv-compta-zik
```

The build uses Java 25, matching the Gradle configuration in `build.gradle.kts`.
Do not deploy this service with a generic Java 17 S2I/runtime image unless the
project is first downgraded to Java 17.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/mserv-compta-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling>.
